# bom data

This directory is a bit disorganized, it might be cleaned up later when time permits.
The data in here can mostly just be used as examples, I mostly just wanted to keep these files somewhere so they don't get lost for me.

It contains the resulting BOMs that were used on mouser and it contains the extracted component ids column from the BOMs.

BOMs are taken from https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack
